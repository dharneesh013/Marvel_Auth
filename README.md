## Marvel_Auth
Alternate login mechanism based on grids instead of normal alpha-numeric mechanism. It will sort out the problems raised due to long complexity 
difficult passwords and easy to crack short passwords.

time when a user login it will ask to select the grids that the user set as a password during the registration process.
