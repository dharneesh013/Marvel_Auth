## Marvel_Auth
Alternate login mechanism based on grids instead of normal alpha-numeric mechanism. It will sort out the problems raised due to long complexity 
difficult passwords and easy to crack short passwords. 

## Security principles

### Bruteforcing
> Bruteforcing cannot be possible in this login mechanism. Dictionary based attacks and common password attacks can't be suuported over here. Every
time when a user login it will ask to select the grids that the user set as a password during the registration process.

### Shoulder surfing
> Shoulder surfing refers to see what does the user types as a password during login/registartion process. In this login mechanism the selection of
grids was minimized so it is difficult to estimate the selection of grids for the attacker.
